# 0x03. Log Parsing

This project focuses on log parsing using Python programming, emphasizing parsing and processing data streams in real-time. The goal is to read from standard input (stdin), handle data in a specific format, and perform calculations based on the input data.

## Project Details

- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** March 25, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** March 29, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date:** March 26, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Concepts Needed

- **File I/O in Python:**
  - Reading from sys.stdin line by line.
  - Python Input and Output

- **Signal Handling in Python:**
  - Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
  - Python Signal Handling

- **Data Processing:**
  - Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
  - Aggregating data to compute summaries.

- **Regular Expressions:**
  - Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
  - Python Regular Expressions

- **Dictionaries in Python:**
  - Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
  - Python Dictionaries

- **Exception Handling:**
  - Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
  - Python Exceptions

By studying these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
